What's your favorite fruit? Mine's watermelon :) 
Wait, are raisins a fruit? What kind of fruit gets sold in little snack containers?! Absurd. Did you know that grapes are left on trees to dry then harvested as raisins only after they are shriveled? Weird world we're living in, huh? 

Well, I guess HELLO weird and wonderful world.

Wack.
