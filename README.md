# hello-world

What's your favorite fruit? Mine's watermelon :) 
Wait, are raisins a fruit? What kind of fruit gets sold in little snack containers?! Absurd. Did you know that grapes are left on trees to dry then harvested as raisins only after they are shriveled? Weird world we're living in, huh? 

Well, I guess HELLO weird and wonderful world.

Wack.




Aaaaaaand we're back! Arthur here with our next question of the day. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? Ah, an African or European swallow, you ask? Let's say... neither. It's an Asian swallow. We don't discriminate in this corner of the interweb!

Anyways, I hope you're kicking life in the butt as much as it's kicking mine! (midterms ;-;)

Love ya <3
